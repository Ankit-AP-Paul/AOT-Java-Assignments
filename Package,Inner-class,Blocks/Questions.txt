Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to learn access specifiers and package, inner class and blocks.

1. Create a class containing some public and private data and having one public method.
Access private data from outside the class after satisfying some criteria of the public
method.

2. Create a class with variable(s) and method(s) (all will be default accessed) under package
pOne. Now create a class under package pTwo, which is subclass of firstly created class. In
the method here (i.e. class of pTwo) call variable(s) and method(s) of previous class (i.e.
class of pOne). If errors come, rectify them. Now from Main (under working directory)
access second class’s members.

3. Create an interface containing three methods, in a package ‘pkgOne’. Implement the
interface from a class under package pkgTwo. From main, under working directory, create
object of the class and call methods of interface.

4. Show that ordinary block is executed when object is created and also the order of execution
of these blocks (for multiple blocks/ inherited block).

5. Show that static block is executed at the time of class loading and also the order of execution
of these blocks (for multiple blocks/ inherited block).

6. Create a class which contains an inner class. Show that inner class can use member of outer
class directly, but Outer class can use member of Inner class only through its object. Check
the name of class file, you created.

7. Write a program to demonstrate anonymous inner class (using super class and interface)
