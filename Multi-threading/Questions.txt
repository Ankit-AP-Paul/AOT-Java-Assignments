Objective:
The objective of this Assignment is to learn Multi-Threading concept.

1.	Inherit a class from Thread and override the run( ) method. Inside run( ), print  name of thread , and then call sleep( ). Repeat this three times, then return from run( ). Put a start-up message in the constructor. Make your thread object and main thread run to see what happens. 

2.	Implement a class from Runnable and override the run( ) method. Inside run( ), print full qualified name of thread, and then call sleep( ). Repeat this three times, then return from run( ). Put a start-up message in the constructor. Make your thread object and main thread run to see what happens.

3.	Make several threads (say 5) with names (by extending thread), set their priority and run them to see what happens.

4.	Make several threads (say 5) with their names (implementing Runnable) set their priority and run them to see what happens.

5.	Implement program of locking of common method by several threads. (Using the keyword ‘synchronized’).

6.  Write a program to use join() and isAlive() in Multi-Threading. 

7.  Inter thread communication :Consumer consumes item produced by Producer with proper synchronization.
